### i recommend reading problem statement before seeing the code 

##this irctcCLI.js file can be run in both nodeJS and in browser 
--for devs--
1 remove first line named prompt sync and uncomment console logs for days and PRNarr 
2 now open irctc.html in browser and see the console for full object views

--for only getting output--
just install nodeJS in your pc and run the code with 'node irctcCLI.js' command 


-this code is memory effecient because it generates the objects when they are needed and can also be integrated with mongoDB and frontend of any sort easily
